Subject: mmc: skip detection of nonremovable cards on rescan

mmc_rescan checks whether registered cards are still present before
skipping them, by calling the bus-specific ->detect() handler.

With buses that support runtime PM, the card may be powered off at
this point, so they need to be powered on and fully reinitialized before
->detect() executes.

This whole process is redundant with nonremovable cards; in those cases,
we can safely skip calling ->detect() and implicitly assume its success.
